The era of graphene is far from over! More and more intricate phenomena emerge as we improve our ability to finely tune the configuration, structure, and shape of graphene flakes with high precision. Our group at CIC nanoGUNE, in collaboration with groups at DIPC and CFM, as well as others in Spain [1], has discovered that graphene flakes fabricated in custom shapes with atomic precision exhibit magnetic phases. These phases can be detected with atomic resolution using scanning tunneling microscopy, opening the door to exploring unique configurations for interacting spins and the various mechanisms behind their emergence. In this talk, I will present our research in this field, showcasing some paradigmatic examples of graphene nanostructures. If time permits, I will also introduce novel scenarios for graphene systems that are the focus of our laboratory.
