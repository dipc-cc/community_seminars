The rich chemistry of transition metals permits them to undergo a great variety of reactions when found in biological environments. As such, metals fulfil multiple fundamental tasks in life organisms, and the homeostasis of bio-metals (i.e. Fe, Zn and Cu) is highly regulated. Equally, numerous anthropogenic metallic devices such as inorganic complexes or metal nanomaterials are currently being developed as biomedical or biotechnological tools. However, the same varied reactivity shown by metals makes challenging to explore their fate and mechanisms of action in biological samples, hampering their development into clinical or industrial use.
