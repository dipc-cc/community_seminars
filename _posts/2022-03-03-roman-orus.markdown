In this talk I'll give an overview of my main lines of research. First, I will explain tensor network states and methods and show recent results where we have used them to study quantum matter and improve machine learning algorithms. Then, I will explain the current status of quantum computing, the most promising algorithms for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Devices, and how these can start to be applied to real-life industrial problems in a variety of verticals. Finally, I will give some overall perspectives on the field of quantum technologies.
